# Overdose API V2 

A reverse-engineered API for *Orion Drift*.

This API is still under development and in a rough state. The Python server is highly buggy, unfinished, and lacks actual server-side code—only the endpoints are currently functional. If you are looking for a fully working server, this isn’t it just yet. However, the full API schema is available in an OpenAPI-formatted `.json` file, which provides a list of every endpoint. Endpoints are simple you should be figure out what some shit does by the name.
